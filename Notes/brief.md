The goal is to create a “one page” type website that shows all the necessary information on the front page, and then a couple other simple pages for the show notes and a contact form.


The header should be very dark with the 3 images for each of his 3 podcasts. The height of the header might be the height of the images and would scale with the width of the page to keep the images full width, up to a point. The donate and contact buttons will be in this header somewhere. Below that will be a white content area with near black text. The text will be in columns under each show image and will show a brief description of the podcast. Finally, a footer bar might contain any additional information, such as his tribute to his dog.


On the show notes, the 3 icons in the header will be replaced by the icon for the selected podcast and the description next to it. This will probably have a max width of around 1000px, depending on the amount of content that goes in it. Each of the show notes will be listed below in a simple blog-style list format. It will be paginated.


On mobile, the header will retain its shrink method and the icons will be fairly small. The columns will turn into buttons that expand content when tapped. The show notes header will also break from 2 columns to a vertical layout.


This layout and mobile support should be easily accomplished with some basic HTML and CSS. Little JavaScript will be required. The only place where JavaScript will be necessary is for the buttons on the home page that toggle some content.


Wordpress will be used as the CMS. Templates will have to be created for the Home Page, List Pages, and 404 Page. The rest can probably be disabled for simplicity’s sake.


The first step will be to create the layouts and UI with fake content. The layout can then be broken apart into template elements and put into Wordpress.
